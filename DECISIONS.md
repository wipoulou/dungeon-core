# Main Decisions

This file tracks major design and implementation decisions for the Dungeon Core project.

## 2025-08-10: Modularization for mobs and classes

- Switched to ES modules. `index.html` now loads `main.js` as `type="module"`.
- Added `src/constants.js` for shared constants and tile helpers.
- Added `src/mobs.js` with a MobRegistry and a few default mob types (slime, goblin, sentry).
- Added `src/classes.js` with registries for classes/traits and a `makeMember(level)` helper.
- `main.js` refactored to place typed mobs and to generate party members via the class registry.
- Mob tiles now track type and HP per tile; regen respects mob type.

Next: add UI to choose mob type to place; expose hooks for class/trait abilities in interactions.

## 2025-08-10: Persist Regular party rosters

- Extended Regulars memory to save a lightweight party roster template: each member's level, class, and trait.
- When a Regular party re-enters later, they respawn with the same roster, fully healed (HP) and with fresh MP.
- Memory format in localStorage now includes `members` array per party id. Backward compatible: absence of `members` falls back to random generation.
- Party Inspector shows a "Saved roster" summary when viewing a memory-only party.

## 2025-08-10: Build mode UX improvements

- Build toolbar now keeps the selected tool visually highlighted. The default is "Room".
- Hover preview: when moving the cursor over the grid, the current tool shows a transparent preview of the tile at the hovered position.
- Placement validation: all non-room builds (mob, trap, loot) require an existing Room tile. Invalid targets render a red hover highlight and clicking does not spend mana or change the tile.
- Mana is only deducted on successful placement; failed attempts no longer consume mana.

## 2025-08-11: GitHub Pages deployment

- Added GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/pages.yml` to deploy the static site on pushes to `main`.
- Added `.nojekyll` to bypass Jekyll processing so module imports work.
- Updated `README.md` with the Pages URL and local run instructions.

## 2025-08-11: Build UX â€” drag-to-build Rooms

- Added drag placement for the Room tool in `main.js`.
- Holding the mouse button and dragging creates multiple rooms in a line while mana lasts.
- Invalid placements are silently skipped during drag (no mana spent), consistent with click behavior.
- Suppresses the trailing click after a drag so the last tile isn't double-placed or logged.
