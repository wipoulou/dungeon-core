## **Core Game Concept**

* You play as a **dungeon core**, feared and exploited by a nearby town for the resources and loot you generate.
* Goal: **Sustainably farm mana** through adventurer activity — wounds, spellcasting, loot drops, resource harvesting, and kills.
* Town tolerates you as long as you produce value and don’t become politically or economically intolerable.

## **Dungeon–Town Relationship**

**Town Dynamics**

* Discovery of a dungeon = mandatory report to **Adventurer Association** → sends a **high-level guard** to control access and enforce rules.
* The guard is not your ally — they protect the town’s interest but tolerate you while you’re profitable.

**Guard/Bouncer NPC**

* Enforces “the pact” — can trigger raids for political, economic, or safety violations.
* Can be customized with **skins** (each with gameplay bonuses).
* Examples: Bouncer, Royal Inspector, Monster Slayer, Silent Sentinel, Guild Envoy, Fallen Hero.

**Town Growth**

* Starts as a tiny hamlet → grows through visible stages to a city hub.
* Growth mostly **cosmetic + difficulty tier progression**, with a few meaningful interactions (guild board requests, guard tension meter, gossip).
* Buildings unlock in milestones (guild hall → guard post → hospital → training yard → mage tower/temple, etc.).

## **Adventurer Flow & Groups**

**Movement**

* One-way dungeon with teleport-out points; sectors have loot/resource depletion to spread traffic.
* “Hot” sectors = higher danger/reward; “cold” = safer/less loot.

**Types of Adventurers**

1. **Regulars**

   * Recurring parties, high political cost to kill, learn your dungeon & adapt, can become “Core Threat” if they outscale you.
2. **Travelers**

   * Passing parties bringing new loot, gear, and summons (unlock mobs), unpredictable tactics, low political cost to kill.
3. **Specialists** (rare travelers, announced on entry)

   * **Cartographer** → improves map accuracy for town (counters dungeon adaptation).
   * **Treasure Hunter** → extracts rare loot faster (economic impact).
   * **Beast Tamer** → introduces new mob blueprints.
   * These are high-impact and worth special player decisions.

## **Loss Conditions**

* **Political Raid** → kill rate too high, town sends raid.
* **Economic Raid** → loot output too low.
* **Core Breach** → party reaches core with insufficient wounds/loot.
* **Rogue Regulars** → regulars outpace your growth and slip past guard oversight.

## **Mana Economy**

**Gain Sources**

* Bleeding, spellcasting, loot drops, resource harvesting, kills (biggest spike).
* Higher-level adventurers = much more mana.

**Spend Categories**

* Mobs (one-time cost), traps (high build, low upkeep), path/room creation, loot creation, resource nodes.

**Progression Model**

* Idle/incremental loop: stronger mobs/traps → stronger adventurers → more mana.
* Different mana “flavors” possible (blood, arcane, greed) for upgrades.
* No mana cap — costs scale with progression.

---

## **Bosses**

* 5–8 base archetypes (Juggernaut, Swarm Mother, Caster, Trickster, Executioner, etc.).
* Procedural variation in appearance, personality, signature mechanic.
* Can evolve from victories, loot digestion, or town events.

---

## **Fairy Companion**

* Tutorial + narrative bridge between you and the outside world.
* Has personality variants (sassy, cautious, chaotic).
* Gives hints, side tasks, gossip, specialist warnings.

---

## **Specialization System**

* **Mob family specialization** instead of direct element system — elements are a byproduct of mob type.
* Example families: Beasts, Elementals, Undead, Constructs, Ghosts.
* Each has distinct visuals, strengths, weaknesses, and trap synergies.
* Weaknesses emerge naturally via mob type, not as an extra layer to manage.

---

## **Adventurer Classes & Traits**

* Classic roles (warrior, shield bearer, archer, ranger, assassin, mage, spell slinger, druid, healer, bard, engineer/artificer, beast tamer).
* Traits add personality & mechanics (e.g., Mana Sink, Trap Enthusiast, Show-off, Efficient Caster).
* Good traits = you might **favor** them mid-run; bad traits = you might **mark** them for death.
* Favoring: mobs offer healing potion/amulet in downtime.
* Marking: mob makes cut-throat gesture → other mobs target them harder.

---

## **Cult Mechanic**

* Independent, cult-like faction occasionally makes requests (“kill this group,” “stop releasing swords”).
* Rewards: rare loot, mana surges, unique mob unlocks.
* Risks: political/economic fallout, guard suspicion, town distrust.
* Acts as an **anti-passivity pressure** system — lures you into risky plays for short-term gain.

---

## **Complexity Management**

* Many systems, so complexity introduced in stages:

  1. Dungeon building + mana basics.
  2. Adventurer flow + loot shaping.
  3. Guard politics + town growth.
  4. Bosses + fairy companion.
  5. Mob family specialization.
  6. Advanced adventurer dynamics (traits, specialists).
  7. Cult offers.
